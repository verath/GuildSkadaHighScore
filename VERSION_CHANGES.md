Version 1.0.4

* Added an action to remove ALL stored parses (found the in the settings: Interface->GuildSkadaHighScore).
* Made the addon track only the raids of the current expansion.
* Using blizzard's localization for difficulty names (the only noticeable difference should be that "LFR" is now "Looking For Raid").
* Some small performance improvements, via mikk's [FindGlobals](https://www.wowace.com/addons/findglobals/).
* Some minor code cleanup/reorganization.
